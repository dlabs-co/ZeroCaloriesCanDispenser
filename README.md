ZeroCaloriesCanDispenser
========================

This project aims to get a zero-calories-consumed-to-get-a-can can dispenser.
We all know it's not really zero-calories, brain also consumes energy, but it'll
be zero-movement and very-low calories consuming dispenser.

This is achieved by using a MindWave (tm) connected by bluetooth to an arduino
relay board trough cooking hacks' XBee bluetooth module <todo: put link here>.

Hardware
========

* Mindwave
* Arduino Uno
* Relay board
* Xbee
* Xbee bluetooth module by cooking-hacks
* Can dispenser
    - This prototype has been made with the following items:
    - Old computer case
    - Old computer CD reader
    - Ikea can dispenser for fridges
    - Peltier cell for cooling
    - Imagination, making spirit.

Hardware howto
==============

Coming soon!


Software
==========

You'll find the needed arduino in mindwave_arduino/ directory, just burn and
have fun!
